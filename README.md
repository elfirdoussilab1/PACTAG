The idea is to create a kit that transforms any cultivable surface (vegetable garden, houseplant, flower boxes etc.) into a connected surface thanks to a mobile application that enables the user to remotely monitor and manage the water, light and temperature of the plantation. The use of a kit system allows different types of uses and offers a scalable solution (possibility of enlarging the cultivabe area).
